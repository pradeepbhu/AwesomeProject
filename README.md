## Add New Item App

# Description

The Add New Item application is a React Native app that allows users to add, update, and manage a list of employees. Users can enter details such as name, email, mobile number, age, employee ID, department, and address. The data is stored and managed using Redux.

# Features

Update existing employee information.
S
Form validation for input fields.

Redux for state management.

Toast notifications for feedback.

Responsive UI design.

Installation

Prerequisites

# Node.js installed version (v20.18.0)

React Native CLI installed

Android Studio or Xcode (for running the application on an emulator or physical device)

A React Native-compatible device or simulator

Steps to Install & Run

Install Dependencies

npm install
# or
yarn install

Run the Application

For Android:

# npx react-native run-android

Usage

Open the application.

Fill in the form fields with the required details.

Click on "Submit" to save the data.

If editing an existing item, update the details and submit.

The list will automatically refresh after adding or updating an item.

Known Limitations & Assumptions

The app currently supports only mobile platforms (iOS & Android) and does not have a web version.

The form requires all fields to be filled before submission.

No backend integration yet; data is managed within the Redux store.

The app assumes users will enter valid employee details manually.
